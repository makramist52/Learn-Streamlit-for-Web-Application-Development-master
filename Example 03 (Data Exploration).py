Description about Example:

This Streamlit code creates a data exploration app that allows users to interactively explore a dataset. 
It loads a dataset (typically in CSV format), displays it in a user-friendly interface, and provides a 
sidebar filter to select a specific species from the dataset. The app dynamically updates and displays the 
filtered data based on the user's species selection, making it easy to investigate and analyze data 
subsets within the dataset.

def load_data():
    data = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")  # Replace with your dataset
    return data

data = load_data()

# Sidebar filters
species = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select species:", data["variety"].unique())

# Explaination about @st.cache_resource function:

# Caching is a technique used in this Streamlit code to improve the performance of loading and processing the dataset. 
# Let's explain why caching is beneficial and why it's used in this context:

# Performance Improvement: Loading a dataset, especially a large one, can be a time-consuming operation. Without caching, 
# every time a user interacts with the app (e.g., selects a different species), the load_data function would be called, 
# and the dataset would be read from the CSV file. This can lead to unnecessary delays in app responsiveness.

# Caching Mechanism: The @st.cache decorator is used to apply caching to the load_data function. When you decorate a 
# function with @st.cache, Streamlit caches the results of the function based on its inputs. If the function is called 
# with the same inputs again, Streamlit retrieves the cached result instead of re-executing the function. This 
# eliminates the need to repeatedly load the dataset from disk, resulting in faster response times.

# User Experience: Caching significantly improves the user experience. Users can interact with the app seamlessly without 
# experiencing delays caused by dataset loading. It creates a smoother and more responsive interface.

# Efficiency: Caching reduces the computational load on the server. For example, if multiple users are accessing the 
# app simultaneously, caching ensures that the dataset is loaded only once and then shared among users when they request 
# it with the same inputs. This reduces the server's computational overhead.
